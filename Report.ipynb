    "## About the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the entire assignment has been done in Python 3 instead of Python 2. This required porting the entirety of the code provided by Berkeley to Python 3. This has largely been successful, with one exception. Random number generation in python >= 3.2 behaves differently from earlier versions. This causes test `q3/8-pacman-game` to fail, as it depends on the old behaviour of `random`. This has been confirmed by running that specific test with Python 2 instead, where it did indeed pass. The error can be reproduced by passing the `-R` switch to the Python 2 interpreter, where an otherwise passing test will suddenly fail, because of hash randomization enabled by the `-R` switch. Otherwise all tests pass with Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The porting was assisted by the package `2to3` and the changes can be viewed [here](https://github.com/JakobGM/minimax/commit/87b5007df1a5aaadbae9313627b38163275d7749).\n",
